Got a string of words bunched together with no spaces? 

Want to be able to read thelongestdomainnameintheworldandthensomeandthensomemoreandmore.com with ease?

Just run the script and call the ```splitter``` function:

```
>>> splitter("splitthisstringintodistictwords")
```

Returns:

```
split this string into distinct words
split this string in to distinct words
```

For any splittable string you pass it, the function will return the possibilities for inserting spaces.

Modify ```word-list.txt``` with your own words/names which you'd to recognise. The current list is from http://www.curlewcommunications.co.uk/wordlist.html
