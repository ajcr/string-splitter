Basic function to tokenise a string of words which has no delimiters. Handy for breaking up domain names.

Run the script and then pass a string to the `splitter()` function. The function will output the possible ways the string can be tokenised into English words (or whatever words are in the `word-list.txt` file.)

```python
>>> splitter('splitthisstring')
'split this string'
```

`word-list.txt` is taken from http://www.curlewcommunications.co.uk/wordlist.html
