Got a load of words bunched together with no spaces? 

Want to be able to read 

thelongestdomainnameintheworldandthensomeandthensomemoreandmore.com 

with ease?

Just run the script and call the ```splitter``` function on the string:

```
>>> splitter("splitthisstringintodistictwords")
```

returns:

```
split this string into distinct words
split this string in to distinct words
```

For any splitable string you pass it, the function will print the possibilities for inserting spaces. It ignores punctuation, capitalisation and existing spaces.

It's possible to modify ```word-list.txt``` so that the script will recognise different words. The current list is from http://www.curlewcommunications.co.uk/wordlist.html
